## Code:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BayminBamu/Roblox-Aimbot-Script-made-by-ChatGPT/refs/heads/main/Aimbot%20Script.lua"))()
```

# Features
## Camera lock
Of course the main part obviously self-explanatory.
## Team Check
Checks whether if the nearby player is in the team or not, if its not then it will target the player.
## Whitelist
Type the name of any player and it will target that player.
In order to Un-Whitelist you need to click one of their names in the GUI list
## Draggable GUI
Also self-explanatory.
